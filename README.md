date_of_month: Day number of the month (1 to 31).
day_of_week: Day of week (1 to 7).
births: Number of births that day.

Objective of this project:
1. Create a function to calculate Number Of Births Each Month
2. Create a function to calculating Number Of Births Each Day Of Week
3. Create a General Purpose Function to calculate #. of births for all metrics (year, month, day of month, day of week).

Goal of this project:
1. How to read, parse and tokenize CSV file
2. Learn about dictionaries and branching conditionals 
3. Learn the basics of functions
